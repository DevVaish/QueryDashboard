-- Query History Section: Displays past queries.

-- Results Display Area: Shows mock data visualizations.

-- Loading & Error States: Handles query processing and error scenarios.

## 🔧 State Management

-- Uses Redux for global state management.

-- Manages query submission, processing, and result states.

-- Includes actions and reducers for handling query interactions.

## 🎨 Design Considerations

-- Clean and modern UI.

-- Responsive design.

-- Intuitive user experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-- Frontend: React.js
