## *📌 Overview*

Welcome to the Query Dashboard Prototype, a React-based single-page application (SPA) designed to simulate an AI-powered data analytics tool. This project is part of an assignment for a frontend engineering internship.

🚀 Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a strategic marketing approach for a Gen AI Analytics tool that empowers non-technical teams to:

Ask complex business questions directly.

Get instant, accurate insights from databases.

Eliminate dependency on data teams.

Make faster, data-driven decisions.

📜 Features

🖥️ UI Components

Query Input Field: Accepts natural language queries and provides AI-powered suggestions.

Query History Section: Displays past queries.

Results Display Area: Shows mock data visualizations.

Loading & Error States: Handles query processing and error scenarios.

🔧 State Management

Uses Redux for global state management.

Manages query submission, processing, and result states.

Includes actions and reducers for handling query interactions.

🎨 Design Considerations

Clean and modern UI.

Responsive design.

Intuitive user experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

State Management: Redux

Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI
